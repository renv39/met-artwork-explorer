          The Metropolitan Museum of Art, colloquially referred to as the
          Met,[a] is an encyclopedic art museum in New York City. By floor area,
          it is the fourth-largest museum in the world and the largest art
          museum in the Americas. With 5.36 million visitors in 2023, it is the
          most-visited museum in the United States and the fifth-most visited

          In 2000, its permanent collection had over two million works;[1] it
          currently lists a total of 1.5 million works.[7] The collection is
          divided into 17 curatorial departments. The main building at 1000
          Fifth Avenue, along the Museum Mile on the eastern edge of Central
          Park on Manhattan&apos;s Upper East Side, is by area one of the
          world&apos;s largest art museums. The first portion of the
          approximately 2-million-square-foot (190,000 m2) building was built in
          1880. A much smaller second location, The Cloisters at Fort Tryon Park
          in Upper Manhattan, contains an extensive collection of art,
          architecture, and artifacts from medieval Europe.

      The Metropolitan Museum of Art was founded in 1870, the museum was
      established by a group of American people, including philanthropists,
      artists, and businessmen, with the goal of creating a national institution
      that would inspire and educate the public.[8] The museum&apos;s permanent
      collection consists of works of art ranging from the ancient Near East and
      ancient Egypt, through classical antiquity to the contemporary world. It
      includes paintings, sculptures, and graphic works from many European Old
      Masters, as well as an extensive collection of American, modern, and
      contemporary art. The Met also maintains extensive holdings of African,
      Asian, Oceanian, Byzantine, and Islamic art. The museum is home to
      encyclopedic collections of musical instruments, costumes, and decorative
      arts and textiles, as well as antique weapons and armor from around the
      world. Several notable interiors, ranging from 1st-century Rome through
      modern American design, are installed in its galleries.
